In this Spring Boot application, we implement functionality to import product data from Excel files into a MySQL database. Utilizing the Apache POI library, the application reads and parses Excel files, extracting product information which is then persisted using Spring Data JPA. The process begins with users uploading an Excel file through a web interface, facilitated by the `MultipartFile` class. The application then processes the file, iterating over rows and cells using Apache POI's `XSSFWorkbook`, `XSSFSheet`, `Row`, and `Cell` classes to map data accurately to the `Product` entity. This integration ensures efficient handling of bulk product data, streamlining the data import process within the application.
